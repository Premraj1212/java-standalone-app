## Demonstrated usage of JaCoCo code coverage tool

[Disclaimer :: I have made an attempt to learn the unit testing practices and long way to go.]

JaCoCo is a free and open-source code coverage library for Java, developed by the EclEmma team. 
It helps you measure how much of your code is actually executed by your tests, providing valuable insights into the quality and 
completeness of your test suite.

* Measures code coverage at different levels: line, branch, and cyclomatic complexity.
* Integrates seamlessly with various build systems and testing frameworks like JUnit, Maven, and Gradle.
* Generates reports in various formats, including HTML, XML, and CSV.
